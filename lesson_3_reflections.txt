When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    When you want to share your repository to others or when multiple people are
    contributing to the project.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Because you would want to be aware and see the changes someone else has made
    to the section of the code you are currently working on.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    A fork is a copy of a source repository in github where the copy knows (points to)
    its parent (source) repository. Fork is used to create variation of an existing
    repository
    A clone is a local copy of a remote repositorythat is usually in github. A clone is
    performed to bring a repository locally to start making changes.
    A branch starts a new commit chain from the currently checked-out commit within
    the same repository. A branch is made to explore or experiment variations within
    a project without affecting the working version of the code in say the master
    branch.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    It allows you to get the latest code from the remote before you go offline
    and lets you compare the status of your branch with the last known state
    of the remote while letting you to continue working on your branch
